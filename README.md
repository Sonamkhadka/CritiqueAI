# Critique AI

A web tool that analyzes the logical structure and emotional tone of argumentative text using state-of-the-art AI models via OpenRouter (free), with options for OpenAI GPT-4o, DeepSeek Chat, and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro when you provide your own API keys.

## Project Objective

Critique AI aims to democratize access to advanced argument analysis techniques through AI. By breaking down the components of logical argumentation (claims, premises, fallacies) and providing insights on emotional tone and critical evaluation, Critique helps users:

- Better understand the structure and quality of arguments
- Identify logical fallacies and weaknesses in reasoning
- Discover unstated assumptions and counterarguments
- Improve critical thinking skills through detailed analysis

The project strives to make critical reasoning tools accessible to students, educators, writers, and anyone engaged in persuasive communication.

## Core Features

- **Free Access via OpenRouter**: Access free models including Grok, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, and more through OpenRouter
- **Popular Example Arguments**: Quick-start with pre-loaded controversial topics like climate change, social media, economics, and education
- **Configurable Models**: Easily customize available AI models through environment variables
- **Premium AI Models**: For those who want to use their own API keys, choose between OpenAI (GPT-4o), DeepSeek (DeepSeek Chat), and Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Claim & Premises Extraction**: Automatically identify the main claim and supporting premises
- **Fallacy Detection**: Identify logical fallacies in arguments with detailed explanations
- **Emotional Analysis**: Score emotional content across five dimensions (Anger, Sadness, Joy, Fear, Surprise)
- **Critical Evaluation**: Assess strengths, weaknesses, and unstated assumptions
- **Neobrutalism Design**: Bold, aggressive UI that matches the app's confrontational approach
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 requests per minute to prevent API abuse
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **Choose an Example or Enter Your Own**: Select from popular debate topics (climate change denial, social media debates, economic arguments, etc.) or write your own argument
2. **Select AI Model**: Choose from configurable OpenRouter free models or use your own API keys for premium services
3. **Analyze**: Click the bold "DESTROY THIS ARGUMENT" button to process your text
4. **Review Results**: View comprehensive analysis with logical structure, emotional tone, fallacies, and counter-arguments

Behind the scenes:
- The frontend UI sends the text to the backend
- The backend forwards it to the selected AI API with "Logos" persona instructions
- The AI returns a structured JSON response
- The application parses and displays the results

Expected JSON structure:
```json
{
  "claim": "Main argument claim",
  "premises": ["Supporting premise 1", "Supporting premise 2"],
  "emotions": {
    "Anger": 0.2,
    "Sadness": 0.1,
    "Joy": 0.5,
    "Fear": 0.3,
    "Surprise": 0.4
  },
  "fallacies": [
    {
      "name": "Appeal to Authority",
      "explanation": "Relying on an authority figure's opinion..."
    }
  ],
  "criticalEvaluation": {
    "weaknesses": ["Weakness 1", "Weakness 2"],
    "assumptions": ["Assumption 1", "Assumption 2"],
    "strength": "Overall argument strength assessment"
  },
  "counterArguments": ["Counter argument 1", "Counter argument 2"]
}
```

## Getting Started / Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/logos-project/logos-argument-analyzer.git
   cd logos-argument-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **API Key Configuration**:

   The application comes with OpenRouter integration for free access to AI models.

   If you want to use premium AI services directly, clone this repository and add the following API keys to your `.env` file:

   - [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/) (included by default)
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (optional, for direct OpenAI access)
   - [DeepSeek API Key](https://platform.deepseek.com/) (optional, for direct DeepSeek access)
   - [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/) (optional, for direct Google Gemini access)

   Configure them in your `.env` file:
   ```
   # Required for free model access
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

   # Optional for premium direct access
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

   # Model Configuration (customize available models)
   DEFAULT_AI_MODEL=openrouter
   DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_MODEL=x-ai/grok-4-fast:free
   OPENROUTER_MODELS=x-ai/grok-4-fast:free,deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free,openai/gpt-4o-mini
   ```

   **Note**: The OPENROUTER_API_KEY is required for free model access. You can customize which models appear in the dropdown by modifying the OPENROUTER_MODELS environment variable.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
